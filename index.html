							<strong>"Limit Order Book (LOB) shape modeling in presence of heterogeneously informed market participants", (2020).</strong></a></li>
							<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
							<i>
								The modeling of the limit order book is directly related to the assumptions on the behavior of real market participants. 
								This paper is twofold. We first present empirical findings that lay the ground for two improvements to these models. The first one 
								is concerned with market participants by adding the additional dimension of informed market makers, whereas the second, and maybe more 
								original one, addresses the race in the book between informed traders and informed market makers leading to different shapes of the order
								book.
								Namely we build an agent-based model for the order book with four types of market participants: informed trader, 
								noise trader, informed market makers and noise market makers. We build our model based on the Glosten-Milgrom approach and the most
								recent Huang-Rosenbaum-Saliba approach. We introduce a parameter capturing the race between informed liquidity traders and suppliers 
								after a new information on the fundamental value of the asset. We then derive the whole "static" limit order book and 
								its characteristics -namely the bid-ask spread and volumes available at each level price- from the interactions between the agents 
								and compare it with the pre-existing model. We then discuss the case where noise traders have an impact on the fundamental value 
								of the asset and extend the model to take into account many kinds of informed market makers.

					   <p><strong>Abstract</strong>
							<i>
								This project consists of numerically modeling bird 
								flocking (birds that fly in an organized group). This phenomenon is one example of a more general phenomenon occurring in 
								biological systems known as swarm intelligence. The system is constituted by a population of agents which can move randomly 
								without any central control structure dictating their behavior. Yet a simple set of rules governing the interaction between agents 
								can lead to global organized structures. In this project, we have implemented a model of agents with biologically motivated interactions,
								governed by simple rules, that exhibits the emergence of self-ordered motion. The model known as the Vicsek model is our starting
								point. Self-organization appears after a symmetry breaking associated with a dynamical phase transition, which is identified and 
								characterized. Many applications can be found for this project.For example a swarm-optimization algorithm can then be implemented, 
								inspired by the bird-flocking phenomenon, to optimize a more general class of problems (For example, optimizing the location of 
								transmission infrastructure for wireless communication networks).

	 						<i>
								The phenomenon we are interested in modelling is the so called ”Rayleigh Benard Convection”. 
								We consider a layer of fluid heated from below in a motionless state. The fluid on the bottom will be lighter than 
								the fluid on the top therefore it will have the tendency to rise to the top of the layer. 
								The gravity and the viscosity of the fluid itself will contrast such motion but, when the temperature gradient is higher
								than a certain threshold, we will be able to observe convective motions in the fluid. We will observe that indeed it is not 
								the temperature gradient to determine the insurgence of convective motions but a critical adimensional parameter
								which links: the temperature gradient, the height of the layer, the kinematic viscosity coefficient, 
								the thermal diffusivity coefficient and the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion.

								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
		 <i>
			The study of market impact (i.e. the way trading influences prices in financial markets) 
			is among the most exciting current themes in theoretical finance, with many immediate 
			applications ranging from trading cost modeling to option pricing. We propose a minimal 
			theory of non-linear price impact based on an order book model, as suggested by general 
			arguments. Our framework allows one to compute the cost of transactions in the presence 
			of a meta-order, that consistently generalizes Black Scholes model an allow to execute 
			optimally an order under certain hypothesis with a dynamic programming equation.

								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
		 <i>The structural study of proteins is of crucial importance for the understanding of how living things work. 
			 Indeed, the functional characterizations of proteins have limits, and it is sometimes necessary to be interested 
			 in their detailed structure to identify their interactions, their role within the cell. 
			 The existing methods (X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy) are limited. In particular, electron microscopy is noisy. 
			 The object of this project has been to couple fluorescence microscopy with electron microscopy, using the former to 
			 identify proteins labeled with a fluorophore. This makes it possible to reduce the noise of the electron microscopy 
			 images by correlating the two images obtained. The ambitious goal was therefore to improve the resolution of 
			 three-dimensional structures of proteins by correlation imaging.</i></p>

								Mouhamad Drame is a PhD student in Applied Mathematics and Market Microstructure under the supervision of Prof Damien Challet 
								and Prof Ioane Muni Toke at MICS (Mathematics and Informatics for Complex Systems) at CentraleSupelec. He is jointly a Quantitative
								Researcher at BNP Paribas Automated Market Making (AMM) team for european futures and equities under Ilan Dahan supervision.
								Previously, Mouhamad was Quantitative Researcher at Jump Trading during his internship where he was working  
								on market microstructure modeling under the supervision of Pierre Laffitte. Prior to joining Jump, he was quantitative fixed income 
								e-trader at HSBC (London and Paris) during a research internship under the supervision of Paul Henry Bacher (Global Head 
								of Fixed Income e-trading) and worked on optimal executions, comovements and lead-lag of european bonds (futures).
								His research interest concerns mainly market microstructures topics, the behavior of agents, the so-called 
								artificial intelligence, auctions, econophysics and any field in which optimisation and statistical physics
								 can be useful to solve complex issues. 
								He graduated from École polytechnique (X2015) and holds an Msc in Probability and Finance 
								at Sorbonne University (DEA El Karoui) with honors.
